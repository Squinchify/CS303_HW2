# CS303_HW2
I have "fixed" my code from HW1 and have given the user the option to select as they wish (Which I should've done from the start)
According to HW2 specificaions I had to delete some of my preventative code to put in the throw/catch that was asked for
You should be able to enter in options that are not on the menu and it will tell you that the option does not exist and that you need to enter in a valid option.
Once sufficiently done with the menu and it's error catching you can exit the menu with input "5"
There it will not give options because the instructions never said I needed to, just to test my classes which I did. It will output to the user a Professional and a nonProfessionals vacation hours earned, how much health tax is deducted from their paycheck, and their weekly salary.

This link is a screenshot of my output: https://prnt.sc/c2OAEVLjIn4u
